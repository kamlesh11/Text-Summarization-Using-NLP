Subtitle quote is a fact that if you have more data about your problem you can extract more information about problem and can solve it much more accurately. Any web scraping code you need to follow the basic steps:

Find the URL(address) of web page you want to scrape Inspect the page and find the data you want to extract Write the logic for extracting the data Store extracted data into structured form(E.g. It creates parse trees that is helpful to extract the data easily. Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. DataFrame({'Product Name':products,'Price':prices})

df.to_csv('products.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')

Data

Web scraping using requests_html

We can scrape data from website by using single library only i.e. we will scrape the data using request_html

Suppose we want to get the repository name, language used and date from github repositories page. name = [] # for storing name of repository

lang = [] # language used in code

date = [] # date updated

for item in list:

tmp = item.text.split('

')

name.append(tmp[0])

lang.append(tmp[1])

date.append(tmp[2])

Now create the data frame to structure the data and further save as csv file. If you’re using Anaconda, you can install the package from the conda-forge channel, which has up-to-date packages for Linux, Windows and OS X.

To install Scrapy using conda, run:

conda install -c conda-forge scrapy

Alternatively, if you’re on Linux or Mac OSX, you can directly install scrapy by:

pip install scrapy

Now we have setup our system so let’s perform web scraping with scrapy. Web Scraping with Scrapy

let’s extract some data again from flipkart. response.css('._4rR01T::text').extract()

Here ._4rR01T is the class name having title of phones. Now this all thing we have done in shell but we actually need data in csv file and not on shell. Creating iphone spider

Now we you’ll see an folder named Iphone having number of files there you’ll also find folder named spiders where the spiders are stored. Now we need to extract name and rating of the iphones from flipkart page.
